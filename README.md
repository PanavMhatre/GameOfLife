# GameOfLife

Overview

Welcome to my Game of Life java project. This is a game i made based on the orginal game of life grid game I have seen. It is a super cool thing and can have wonderful shapes and patterns. You can enter different .TXT files and it while show some really cool patterns. But this isn't random there's some math to it. 

To play it make sure to run the whole folder and not just one file!
